# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Need for Developing This Project
Heart disease is among the top causes of death globally. Early diagnosis can go a long way in lowering the risk and facilitating timely medical treatment.This project offers an **interactive tool** to predict the probability of heart disease from medical features using **machine learning models**. By utilizing **Streamlit**, we make the prediction process **interactive, quick, and available to all**.

## üéØ Who Will Benefit from This Project?
- **Doctors & Healthcare Professionals**: Assists in initial screening.
- **Patients & Individuals**: Gives a risk assessment prior to consulting a doctor.
- **Data Scientists & Researchers**: Shows how machine learning can be utilized in healthcare.

## üß† Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification model to identify heart disease risk.
- **StandardScaler**: For feature scaling to enhance model accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run This Project
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed, then install libraries needed:
```sh
pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

###  2Ô∏è‚É£ Download or Clone the Project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Execute the Streamlit App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Provide Patient Data & Get Prediction
The app will ask for medical information such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Based on the data, it will:
- Predict **High Risk** or **Low Risk** of heart disease.
- Display a **comparison graph** with a healthy person.

## üéØ Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Incorporate **explainability** through SHAP values.
- Host the app on **cloud platforms** such as AWS or Heroku.

üöÄ **Stay healthy and use AI for good!**

## Acknowledgment
- I thank Unified Mentors for providing me a wonderful oppurtunity to pursue internship in the field of Machine Learning getting me industry ready.
- I sucessfully completed building this full-fledged website and training an SVM model.
- Looking forward for more such oppurtunities.
