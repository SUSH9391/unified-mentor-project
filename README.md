# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Need for Developing This Project
Heart disease is among the top causes of death globally. Early diagnosis can go a long way in lowering the risk and facilitating timely medical treatment.This project offers an **interactive tool** to predict the probability of heart disease from medical features using **machine learning models**. By utilizing **Streamlit**, we make the prediction process **interactive, quick, and available to all**.

## 🎯 Who Will Benefit from This Project?
- **Doctors & Healthcare Professionals**: Assists in initial screening.
- **Patients & Individuals**: Gives a risk assessment prior to consulting a doctor.
- **Data Scientists & Researchers**: Shows how machine learning can be utilized in healthcare.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification model to identify heart disease risk.
- **StandardScaler**: For feature scaling to enhance model accuracy.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Project
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed, then install libraries needed:
```sh
pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

###  2️⃣ Download or Clone the Project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

### 3️⃣ Execute the Streamlit App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Provide Patient Data & Get Prediction
The app will ask for medical information such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Based on the data, it will:
- Predict **High Risk** or **Low Risk** of heart disease.
- Display a **comparison graph** with a healthy person.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Incorporate **explainability** through SHAP values.
- Host the app on **cloud platforms** such as AWS or Heroku.

🚀 **Stay healthy and use AI for good!**
